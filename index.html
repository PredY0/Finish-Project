				<p class="tm-mb-40">Hello, I'm Basri Efe but I prefer to use efe. I am 16 years old and my school is Technology High School, my 3rd year in high school. I'm doing well in my classes this year. Actually, I don't study for my classes, but my grades are still good.
					I like to spend time in front of the computer and my friend's brother told us to work on some software, our family took us to the course.
					Actually, I'm good with courses. I went to a 3 year English course and passed the C2 level successfully, I was also bored at first, but when we started to understand things and make new friends, we started to enjoy the course and we continue to improve by working. . I would like to stay longer and chat but for now it would be better to discuss the next projects, take care</p>
